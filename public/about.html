<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a teacher, tutor, and curriculum developer</p>

<p>I coach students on standardized tests (GRE, GMAT, NYS Regents exams). I also teach robotics and computer programming (Python and Web Development).</p>

<p>I strive to create a welcoming classroom environment with "a low floor and a high ceiling" -- there are supports to enable all student to exceed and challenges to push everyone toward a new personal level of excellence</p>
